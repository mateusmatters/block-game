Ideas on how to better improve game for the future

- Drag it to the side better
- Imrprove on the overall visuals of the game
- Have the pieces create a picture
- People have been saying they like the tetris idea (don't know how hard it is to implement)
- Might want to have the ability to implment rotate/flip feature when it comes to the pieces
- put the pieces more centered to the board, had some people comment that it looked cut offf
- win screen at the end
- color pallete should be toned down/duller pastel
- make user interface more addictive, add sounds, win screen, points
- when dragging a remaing piece from the bottom, change the displacement so that it goes to the bottom
(the reason for this is so that the user can automatically see the piece on the board as colored and it Might
be more intuitive)
- color randomizer for pieces
